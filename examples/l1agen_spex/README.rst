Quick test procedure for ``pyspex``
===========================================

The tests descibed in the document are performed using pyspex_ v1.3.7, but
should also be valid for any later release.

The test data files are freely available from the OB-DAAC_.

Quick single input tests
------------------------
This section contains quick tests which can be performed to check the L1A
products generated by ``l1agen_spex.py`` or ``spx1_level01a``.

#. One input file with binning table 20 and 24 data::

   l1agen_spex.py --spex_lv0 <PATH>/SPX000000573.spx

   

#. One input file without Science data, fails with return code 110::

   * l1agen_spex.py --spex_lv0 <PATH>/SPX000000436.spx

Tests using YAML configuration
------------------------------
Operational processing requires multiple file input, including SPEXone L0
products and HKT products. The latter contain the navigation data, necessary to
calculate the geolocation information in the L1B products.

#. Multiple input files, handled as if in eclipse, returning a CAL (diagnostic
   mode) & DARK (science mode) product. This is the content of the YAML file:

    outdir: <PATH>/L1A
    outfile: ''
    file_version: 1
    compression: False
    eclipse: True
    l0_list:
    - <PATH>/SPX000000429.spx
    - <PATH>/SPX000000430.spx
    - <PATH>/SPX000000431.spx
    - <PATH>/SPX000000432.spx
